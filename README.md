# STB-to-nvRaw

STB File Processor is a Python application built using `tkinter` for a simple graphical user interface (GUI). It allows users to select STB files or folders containing STB files and then run various processing scripts on them. These scripts include converting STB files to different formats (Standard Raw or Nvidia Raw).

## Features

- **File and Folder Selection:** Allows users to select a single file or a folder containing multiple STB files.
- **Script Selection:** Users can choose from three processing scripts:
  - **STB to Raw:** Convert the STB file to a Raw format.
  - **STB to NV (0 Padding):** Convert the STB file to NV format with zero padding.
  - **STB to NV (Standard):** Convert the STB file to NV format with standard processing.
- **Simple GUI:** The application is built using `tkinter` for an easy-to-use interface.
- **Cross-platform:** Works on any platform that supports Python and `tkinter`.

## Requirements

To run this application, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- `numpy` (for numerical processing)
- `tkinter` (for the graphical interface)
